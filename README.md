# unity-auto-pause-music
No longer must you manually play & pause your groovy music while testing & debugging your cool game ðŸŽ§ðŸŽµðŸŽ®

**unity-auto-pause-music** automatically plays or pauses Windows system music when Unity enters &amp; exits play mode

This is not an intellegent script - it cannot detect if your music is actually playing, it just simulates a keyboard media play/pause button keypress. So if you pause your music and hit play, you'll end up with both Unity & media music playing!

Windows support only
